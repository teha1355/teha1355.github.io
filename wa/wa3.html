    <h2 id="Name">Name and Symbol</h2>
        <p>
            Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and is also the father of Jupiter. 
            The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols">astronomical symbol</a> can be traced back to the Greek Oxyrhunchus Papyri, the abbreviation for Cronus (the Greek name for the Planet). 
            The Romans named the seventh day of the week Satuday, Saturn's Day, for the planet.

    <h2 id="Rings">Rings</h2>
        <p>
            The rings of Saturn are its most recognizable feature. The rings extend from 6,630 to 12,700 km (4,120 to 75,000 mi) outward from the equator. The average thickness is approximately 20m (66ft). 
            They are composed of mostly water ice but have trace amounts of tholin and a coating of approximately 7% amorphous carbon. The rings are comprised of particles that range from specks of dust to 10m in size. 
            The other gas giants of the solar system also have ring systems; however, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.
            There are two main hypotheses about the origins of the rings. One such hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The reserach team of MIT has proposed the name "Chrysalis" for this moon.
            The second theory is that the rings are left over material from the original nebular material from which the planet was formed.
            Some ice in ring E is comprised from the geysers of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
            The Phoebe ring, beyond the main rings at a distance of 12 million kilometers, is tilted at 27 degrees to the other rings. Like the moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_(moon)">Phoebe</a>, the rings orbit in retrograde fashion.
            Some of the moons, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(moon)">Pandora</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(moon)">Prometheus</a>, act as shepard moons and confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out.

    <h2 id="Atmosphere">Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>
            The outer atmosphere contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.
            The quantity of elements heavier than helium is not known precisely. However, the proportions are assumes to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of the heavier elements is estimated to be 19-31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant amount located in Saturn's core.
            Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are made of ammonia crystals. The lower clouds are comprised of either ammonium hyrdosulfide or water.
            Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere which leads to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the reluting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.
            Cassini observed a series of cloud features found in the northern latitudes, nicknamed the "String of Pearls". These features are cloud clearings the reside in deeper cloud layers.

        <h3>Cloud Layers</h3>

                Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter.
                The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with temperatures in the range of 100-160 K and pressures extending between 0.5-2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. 
                Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185 to 270 K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3-6 bar with temperatures of 190-235 K. 
                Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar and temperatures are 270-330 K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.
                Saturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. 
                The 1990 storm was an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Spot">Great White Spot</a>, a short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice.

        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon">Hexagonal cloud patterns</a></h4>
            <p>
                A persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78Â°N was first noted in the Voyager images.
                The sides of the hexagon are each about 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long, which is longer than the diameter of the Earth.  The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere.
                The pattern's origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.
